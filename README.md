The goal of Graze16 is to provide the same functionality of previous versions, but on a modern
version of Android, addressing the security issues that needed updated to target the new API version.  The initial release targets API level 36 - Android 16.

The initial release fixes the issues in my particular use of the software in that it was getting increasingly difficult to find an APK for it and also that Google are planning to gradually further restrict side-loading, especially of unsigned apps.  Thus, it may
not work entirely for *your* needs.  For example, I do not use Mobilizers or service providers other than NewsBlur.


## Source code and reporting issues

Issue reports can be filed [here](https://github.com/ediflyer/graze16/issues).  However, development time is very limited and likely restricted to major functionality or security issues; you are much more likely to get an issue fixed by providing mergeable pull requests.
