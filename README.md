* This is the GrazeTEN source repository.
* GrazeTEN is based on GrazeRSS, without which GrazeTEN would not exist.
* GrazeRSS is based on the NewsRob project, without which GrazeRSS would not exist.
  * It's turtles all the way down.
* Use of the NewsRob logo and the NewsRob name is not permitted.

The goal of GrazeTEN is to provide the same functionality of previous versions, but on a modern
version of Android.  The initial release targets API level 29 - Android 10 ("Q")

Non-goals include:
* Modernizing UI
* Adding / Changing functionality

The initial release fixes the issues in my particular use of the software.  Thus, it may
not work entirely for *your* needs.  For example, I do not use Mobilizers or service
providers other than NewsBlur.
