# graze16 Privacy policy


* Data collection is **off by default**
* We currently do not intend to collect user data from the app.



---



* The code currently has integration with flurry.com - until it is removed, here is the worst case view:


* graze16 would like to anonymously collect your usage data using flurry.com.
* This data will help the developer understand how you use graze16 so that he can improve it.
* This data collection is strictly opt-in, so if you do not approve no data will be collected. The application will continue to function normally regardless of this setting.
* Currently, only general data will be collected: what device you use, your graze16 and Android versions, which country you are in, which graze16 screens you use and how long you use each screen.
* In the future, more specific data may be collected, such as which menu options you use most frequently, graze16 configuration information, etc. Before this happens however, this dialog will appear again and ask you again to allow this data to be gathered.
* At any time you may open the settings and enable or disable the data collection.
